# Webpack and Typescript notes

## Set Up
- initialize TS: `tsc --init`
- initialize npm: `npm init`
  - Instal dependancies to development section: `npm install webpack webpack-cli ts-loader -D`
    - Webpack CLI allows us to run webpack commands from command line
    - TS-loader helps us ho to compile TS to JS
- Instal TS like a local development dependancy: `npm install typescript -D`
